📊 RMG Production Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a Power BI dashboard developed for analyzing end-to-end performance of a Ready-Made Garments (RMG) manufacturing operation, covering both Textile (Knitting, Dyeing, Finishing) and Garments (Cutting, Sewing, Finishing & Shipment) processes.

🧩 Dashboard Pages
   1️⃣ Textile Dashboard 
![Textile Dashboard](textile.jpg)



      Focus on knitting, dyeing and fabric quality performance.

   2️⃣ Garments Dashboard ![Garments Dashboard](garments.jpg)
      Focus on production efficiency, defect control and shipment performance.

📌 Key Business Insights
🔹 Textile (Knitting, Dyeing & Finishing)

Total knitting output reached 403K KG, but overall efficiency is 78.6%, indicating scope for productivity improvement. 

insights

** Fabric inspection pass rate is only 60.22%, resulting in a high dyeing reprocess rate of 12.37%. 



** Average fabric shrinkage is 6%, which is above the target of 5%, showing weak finishing control. 



** All major buyers show the same inspection pass rate (60.22%), indicating that quality issues are systemic and internal, rather than buyer-specific. 



🔹 Garments (Cutting, Sewing, Finishing & Shipment)

 ** Sewing efficiency is extremely high at 99.26%, with several lines exceeding 152%, suggesting very high productivity but a possible need to review target settings. 



** Finishing achievement is 99.62%, meaning most orders are technically ready for dispatch. 



** Average DHU (Defects per Hundred Units) is 4.50%, which still offers scope for further cost and rework reduction. 



** Despite strong finishing performance, on-time shipment is only 34%, highlighting a major delivery and planning gap. 



** Cutting volume shows a declining trend from 12.6M (2023–24) to 9.9M (2025), which may indicate a potential slowdown in future orders.
